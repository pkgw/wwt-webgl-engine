# @pkgw/engine-types

This package exposes some common [TypeScript] types relating to the AAS
WorldWide Telescope WebGL engine ([@pkgw/engine]). It lets you write code that
works with some of the relevant data and interfaces without having to pull in
the entire engine — which is quite large — as a dependency.
